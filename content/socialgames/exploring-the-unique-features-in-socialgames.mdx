## **Introduction**

With thousands of online games, Socialgame came with its unique features and exciting experience that is yet to be explored in the world of NFT play-to-earn games. There are quite a lot of generic games out there, with the same game settings and story, but Socialgames has decided not to bring the same thing as others. Hence, we combine social and unique experiences to create a massive game that has been attracting web3 enthusiasts and Gamers. So, let’s explore the unique features and why they are unique to Socialgames:

## **A multiverse of themed Worlds:**

The concept of a multiverse under Socialgames refers to the idea of multiple parallel universes, each with its own unique characteristics and properties with common and progressive tokenomics mechanics

Four worlds are available now: Cybercity, Epic Age, Mutantland, and Motorland; the first world (Cybercity) has been launched with 500+ players per month globally. Each of these worlds is themed around a different concept, with Cybercity focusing on a futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic, Epic Age exploring a medieval fantasy world, Mutantland will be featuring mutated NFT and surprises to come, and Motorland being centered around racing and vehicles.

Each world shares the same architecture but different content, it lets us offer new worlds with strong gamification mechanics quite fast. These are the main features of each world. The multiverse concept allows for diverse digital experiences and assets, each with unique value and characteristics.

## **Complete Ecosystem with fresh and new ideas**

**\- Low friction with new players**

New players can access the game without connecting their wallet address; connecting a wallet is not mandatory until you get an NFT or claim prizes.  
And in case players decide not to get an NFT Hero yet, they can use a default character offered by the games for free

As a part of flexibility and uniqueness, we’ve created a Borrow Hero Pass Feature that lets new players test a Hero NFT for free and purchase it later. With the Borrow NFTs feature, we’re able to create a game that allows players to borrow NFTs and use all the buildings in the World, upgrading, training, and leveling up the NFT.

New players can also assemble body parts and mint their Hero for free. Each Hero is composed of 5 parts. They can be collected, and the player can assemble all parts of the same Hero and mint a new Hero for free in the “Cybor corp” engineering floor

**\-Put your Hero NFT to work for you, generating passive income: **  
Players can generate workers (a form of service that can be offered using their Hero NFT) by linking their NFT with a Virtual Profession License NFT, commonly called VPL by the community. According to the VPL type, they could use their Heroes NFTs to serve other players, as a trainer, a builder, a recycler, etc., and earn rewards from the cost assumed by the player “customer.”

**\- Rent your Hero**  
Players can rent their upgraded Heroes to beginners and other players for testing or passing some complicated levels of games

**\- Heroes upgradable and portables cross games**  
Each Hero can be upgraded following these steps:

- Each Hero has a maximum level within their current rank that can be achieved by earning points in games or by eating meals at a restaurant called "Grinders."

- To go beyond that maximum level, the Hero must train with a trainer in the "Gym" to train the next skill and obtain a diploma.

- Finally, the Hero's rank can be upgraded by asking an officer in City Hall. This officer updates the metadata of the Hero's NFT on the blockchain, which is a digital ledger that securely records and verifies the ownership and authenticity of the Hero.

Once the Hero's NFT metadata is updated, the game character object is updated with the upgraded stats and the new skill, including animation, VFX (visual effects), and SFX (sound effects). The new features make the Hero ready to be used on all game platforms.

## **Opportunities for all (League Game):**

Socialgames has 3 Monthly leagues with different requirements to group players of similar levels so that everyone can get a satisfactory experience. There are **Amateur**,** Pro,** and **Stars** Leagues, where players can participate for free.

There are three stages in Leagues:

- The first stage is the Qualifying round, which begins on the 4th day of every month and runs until the 9th day of the month. During this period, players can earn enough points to be promoted to a higher league.

- The second stage is the actual Leagues, which start on the 10th day of the month and end on the last day of the month. The ranking of players is based on the individual user experience points accumulated during the month.

- The third stage occurs in the initial four days of the month after the Leagues end. This stage involves verifying the results and delivering prizes to the players.

The rewards that players receive depend on their League and their position within that League. These rewards can include in-game coins or food required for progress in the game, NFTs, or cryptocurrency such as $MATICS.

## **“Cash” mode on skilled games:**

Socialgames is launching a “Tank Battle game.” The new game mode, Tank Battle Free For All, includes a "cash" bet for entry.

Players can bet on the outcome of each game, adding a new level of excitement and competitiveness to the multiplayer Tank Battle experience. The bet can be made with in-game tokens, and the player can earn rewards from defeated tanks in the battleground.

Importantly, the "cash" game modes are based on skill games only, which means that all players have the same chances to win when the game starts. In other words, the outcome of the game is based solely on a player's skill and strategy rather than luck or chance. This makes the game mode more fair and engaging for all players, adding an extra layer of competition and excitement.

## **League of clubs**

The League of Clubs in Socialgames is based on Official Clubs created on the platform. Each club has a maximum of 25 players allowed.

Several Coop games and team game modes are currently in development where the points gathered by players and teams are added to the Club score. This feature activates the social layer between players because sometimes they must be organized to maximize their results.

Prizes for the League of Clubs are based mainly on the pre-token Soga, and they are given away at the end of the league to the members of the top 5 clubs according to the club position and the individual League pass.

It is important to note that having strong Heroes NFTs is recommended to fight for the top positions in the League of Clubs. This is because the strength of a player's Hero can significantly impact their success in the game, especially in team game modes where cooperation and strategy are important. Overall, the League of Clubs is a social and competitive feature in the game that allows players to team up with others and compete for prizes based on their performance in the game.

## **Amazing in-house creators and developers:**

Socialgames has a team of amazing in-house creators and developers. This means that all the games and experiences on the platform are designed and developed by a talented team dedicated to delivering high-quality gaming experiences.
