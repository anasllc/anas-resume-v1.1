**What is Monte's opinion about Socialgames?**

Monte Singman has chosen to join Socialgames because the project has achieved interoperability, enabling players' Heroes to participate across all games. The platform fosters a sense of community, with players acting as members who manage other players' requests for building upgrades, training, and assistance.

Socialgames offers Game Worlds that share a similar architecture but vary in content, encompassing diverse game styles, new collections for sale, and eventually incorporating third-party games as they expand.
