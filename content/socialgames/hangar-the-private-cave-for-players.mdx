In the world of Socialgames, immersion and personalization are key elements that engage our players and community to keep them amazed and coming back for more fun. Socialgames developers are constantly innovating and introducing new features to enhance the gaming experience, and one such innovation is the introduction of **_“Hangar: The private cave for players.”_**

## **Hangar: The private cave for players**

Hangar is a unique addition to Socialgames that offers you a personal space where you can store and showcase your achievements, gather Heroes body parts, interact with your game progress, and express your creativity.

At the heart of the Hangar concept are the **“Capsules”**, they serve as the building blocks of this personal space. **\*A capsule is formed by combining two things: the cylinder and the base**.\*

In other words, **CYLINDER \+ BASE \= A CAPSULE**

The cylinder is a container available in the game's menu, while the capsule base is a base that accommodates the cylinder. Once these two parts are assembled, they form a complete capsule.

## **Five Capsules Makes A Hero**

Each hero in the game is associated with five body parts. Therefore, you have the opportunity to assemble five capsules, each containing a different body part of the same hero. This creates a sense of excitement and anticipation as you strive to collect all the necessary parts to complete your hero's collection.

Capsules play a pivotal role in the Hangar system. Not only do they represent the culmination of your efforts in collecting the required parts, but they also have additional functionalities.

Once a capsule is revealed, its contents become permanent and cannot be altered. This adds an element of strategy and careful decision-making to the game, as you must choose when and which capsules to reveal to maximize your gameplay advantage.

## **Capsule Colors (Grey, Blue and Green)**

To make the capsule system even more engaging, our developers have introduced different colors for the cylinders. **_Grey, blue, and green represent the rarity levels of the capsules: R1 Common, R2 Uncommon, and R3 Rare, respectively._**

R1 (Common) is Grey  
R2 (Uncommon) is Blue  
R3 (Rare) is Green

The base, on the other hand, is color-neutral and can be paired with any cylinder color. This color-coded system not only adds visual appeal but also allows you to easily identify the rarity of your capsules at a glance.

## **Your Personal Haven**

The Hangar itself serves as a **“personal haven”** for you. It is a customizable space where you can decorate and design your surroundings to reflect your unique style and personality.

The items needed to decorate the Hangar can be obtained through challenges, or bought in the supermarket, or gotten from special events. Whether it's trophies from tournaments, rewards for winning leagues, or items acquired through various in-game achievements, **_you can proudly display your accomplishments in your Hangar._**

Aside from aesthetics, the Hangar also provides functional elements. You will have access to a personal computer within your Hangar, allowing you to view your in-game statistics, track your progress, and strategize for future gameplay.

Additionally, you can earn games to place in your Hangar, creating a virtual arcade-like experience within the game itself. This adds another layer of interactivity and entertainment for you, as you can engage with both the game world and your personal space simultaneously.

## **Five Free Capsules For You: A Free Hero**

To ensure that you have a fair chance to engage with the Hangar system, each player will start with five free capsules by default. These initial capsules allow you to begin building your collections without any additional cost.

However, once these capsules are used up, you will have the option to purchase new ones from the in-game Supermarket or earn them through various challenges and events. This balance ensures that you can continue to engage with the Hangar system while maintaining a sense of progression and achievement.

## **Final Thoughts**

Hangar, the private cave for players, represents an exciting evolution in Socialgames. It introduces a unique and personal space for you to showcase your achievements, express your creativity, and assemble unique and powerful Heroes, and Immerse yourself in a personalized gaming experience.

With the ability to assemble capsules, reveal the contents, and interact with your game progress, you are empowered to take ownership of your gaming journey. The Hangar system not only adds depth and engagement to Socialgames but also provides you with **_a space you can truly call your own in the virtual realm._**

**Note:** The Cyborg Corp Engineering, set to be released by June, will provide you with a platform to assemble your capsules and unlock your hero's full potential.

Anticipate your personal haven\!
