**Introduction**

Socialgames ecosystem has a different way of incentivizing players as a play-to-earn game that goes beyond just playing games. Rewards are distributed via our token to qualified players who have completed all required challenges and met the conditions to be rewarded.

Rewards are given with $SOGA Token while monthly leagues are rewarded with $Matic, but for $SOGA token holders, they can stake to get more $SOGA token as a staking reward. Socialgames platform is centered around $SOGA tokens, which serve as the primary currency in the game. Through the play-to-earn approach, users can earn SOGA tokens by participating in various activities, including playing games, creating Tribes, unlocking achievements, and taking part in special events. These SOGA tokens have multiple applications within the Socialgames platform, including purchasing items from the Shop (such as heroes, gear, and amulets), paying for entry into exclusive events, trading NFTs in the marketplace, and acquiring surprise treasure chests.

**$SOGA Token**

SOGA tokens operate on the blockchain and can be removed from Socialgames and saved in any ERC20-compatible wallet. They can also be exchanged for other tokens on crypto exchanges or staked on our liquidity pools to earn rewards. That’s why in this article, we will focus mainly on explaining the concept of staking and how it works under Socialgames

First, let’s understand what staking means; Staking is a process where users lock up their tokens as collateral to participate in various activities within the blockchain ecosystem and earn rewards. Socialgames is a platform that operates on the blockchain and allows users to participate in gaming activities within the ecosystem.

When you stake your $SOGA, it becomes an active participant in the blockchain's consensus mechanism (Proof of Stake). This mechanism ensures that all transactions on the blockchain are verified and secured without needing a payment processor. By staking your $SOGA, you contribute to this process and help maintain the ecosystem’s security and integrity. You earn rewards on your staked crypto as a reward for your contribution. So how can you stake $SOGA token on Socialgames?

**Staking under Socialgames works in the following way:**

- Users acquire Socialgames tokens ($SOGA) through gaming rewards or by participating in the Socialgames token sale.
- Users then lock up a certain amount of $SOGA tokens in a smart contract on the Socialgames platform. This locked-up amount is called a stake.
- The stake allows the user to participate in various activities on the platform.
- The smart contract automatically releases the stake, and any rewards earned when the user meets certain conditions, such as completing a specific gaming activity or meeting a certain time limit.
- The rewards that can be earned from staking include additional $SOGA tokens, other digital assets, or valuable items to equip your NFT Hero.

**Why should you stake your $SOGA?**

By staking your $SOGA, you can earn more of it as a staking reward, which has a crucial role in facilitating the Socialgames NFT economy. This token allows users to mint various NFTs Heroes, all of which are tradable on our NFT marketplace.

You can participate in the staking by either becoming a liquidity provider or staking your $SOGA token. By doing so, you stand to gain significant $SOGA tokens, which can be used to get rare NFT Heroes and in-app purchases. Overall, staking provides an excellent opportunity for players to increase their earnings and participate in the thriving Socialgames NFT economy.

**Conclusion**

Staking is an important part of the Socialgames ecosystem as it incentivizes users to hold and use $SOGA tokens while also contributing to the security and stability of the platform. By staking your tokens, you are helping maintain the network and will be rewarded for your contribution.
