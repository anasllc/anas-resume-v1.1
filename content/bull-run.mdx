Is the crypto bull run over? This article uncovers how the Bybit hack, Trump’s tariffs, and market dynamics could drive Bitcoin's and Ethereum’s next move.

**TL;DR**

- Bitcoin and Ethereum saw over 10% declines in February 2025, with Bitcoin dropping below $90,000 and Ethereum to $2,235.
- Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China may drive inflation, making crypto a potential hedge amid geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties.
- Market corrections are considered normal, with technical support at $90,000 for Bitcoin and $2,800 for Ethereum suggesting recovery potential.
- The bull run is expected to continue, with dips as buying opportunities and year-end targets of $123,000 for Bitcoin and $4,591 for Ethereum, despite regulation and economic slowdown.

The crypto market is teetering between chaos and opportunity. [Bitcoin](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/), which peaked at $108,000 in January 2025, has slid to a low of $82,000, a drop of over 20% from its high. [Ethereum](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/), battered by the Bybit hack, trades at $2,235, down from $3,600 earlier this year.

With the total market cap holding near $3 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance above 55%, the question looms: **_Is the bull run dead, or is this a dip before the next surge?_**

Investors are wrestling with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to recent events like President Trump’s strategic crypto reserve announcement, new tariffs, and escalating geopolitical tensions. This article cuts through the noise, analyzing current sentiment and key drivers to help you decide whether to hold your crypto or sell now.

## **Recent Price Action: A Market in Turmoil**

The past few months have been a rollercoaster. Bitcoin’s euphoric climb above $100,000 in January—fueled by institutional adoption and spot ETF approvals—crashed by February 27, dipping below $90,000.

The trigger? [The Bybit hack on February 21, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/bybit-crypto-hack-north-korea.html), where North Korea’s Lazarus Group stole $1.5 billion in Ethereum. Bitcoin shed 7.25% in a day, hitting $87,169.76, per Reuters, while Ethereum took a heavier hit, sliding toward $2,235.

Solana, once at $290 in January, now lingers below $160. Despite these losses, the market cap’s resilience hints at underlying strength and what some call “stubborn hope.”

At this junction, sentiment split: Some see a buying opportunity, while others see a warning of deeper declines.

## **Current Events Shaping Sentiment**

The crypto market doesn’t operate in isolation. Here’s how today’s headlines are driving prices and investor mood as of March 6, 2025:

### **Strategic Crypto Reserve**

On March 2, 2025, President Trump unveiled plans for a U.S. "strategic crypto reserve" featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The market erupted—Bitcoin briefly touched $90,000, and altcoins spiked. But by March 4, gains evaporated, with prices retreating amid skepticism.

Bulls cheered the move as a sign of government-backed adoption, potentially paving the way for institutional inflows and regulatory clarity. Yet, bears point to risks just like all other volatility concerns, vague implementation details, and the irony of a decentralized asset under government control.

Sentiment is cautiously bullish but jittery. As some believed, without concrete policy, it’s a wild card. If clarity on when and how has been announced, this could bolster a hold strategy for you or signal a sell if it fizzles into regulatory overreach.

### **Trump’s Tariffs: A Double-Edged Sword**

Trump’s tariffs, implemented on February 4, 2025, impose 25% on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China. They aim to boost U.S. industry but, according to analysts, hit households with an estimated $800 extra tax burden.

[https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1895110272089510048](https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1895110272089510048)

Inflation fears are rising, and economic growth could stall. Crypto’s response is conflicted. Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative quickly became doubtful, drawing investors fleeing fiat weakness. But a risk-off mood could crush speculative assets if growth slows.

The market’s volatility since February suggests that tariffs are a net negative for now, nudging cautious investors toward selling. If you’re risk-averse, this might tip you to lighten your load; if you see Bitcoin as a hedge, holding makes sense.

### **Geopolitical Conflict and the Bybit Hack**

The Bybit hack wasn’t just seen as a theft; it’s a geopolitical flare-up. North Korea’s $1.5 billion Ethereum heist has heightened fears of state-sponsored cyber threats, with Ethereum’s price still reeling.

Broader tensions—like U.S. - North Korea standoffs—add pressure, potentially spurring sell-offs to safer assets. Yet, crypto’s history of bouncing back (think Mt. Gox) offers hope.

The sentiment here is bearish in the short term but resilient in the long term. If you’re rattled by security risks, selling some holdings could ease your nerves; if you trust the rebound, holding—or buying—could pay off.

### **Regulatory Winds: Pro-Crypto Signals**

Trump’s “crypto capital” pledge is bearing fruit. The new SEC head dropped cases against Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, signaling a lighter touch. This has proven to lift sentiment, as many analysts see institutional money waiting on the sidelines, ready to fuel a recovery.

However, the strategic reserve’s ambiguity tempers the mood. For now, it’s a hold-friendly tailwind, though regulatory surprises could shift the sentiment.

### **White House Crypto Summit: Regulatory Clarity or More Uncertainty?**

The White House Crypto Summit, which is hosted by President Trump and chaired by David Sacks, the AI & Crypto Czar, and scheduled for March 7, 2025, will bring together crypto founders, CEOs, and investors.

[https://x.com/davidsacks47/status/1895660834799698008](https://x.com/davidsacks47/status/1895660834799698008)

Discussions may tackle regulatory frameworks, stablecoin rules, and the strategic reserve. As it stands now, some expect clarity to lift prices, while others see it as a non-event or fear restrictive policies.

Currently, the crypto community is in hope and doubt as the question remains: Will it spark a rally or deepen volatility? For you, it’s a hold if you’re optimistic, a sell if you’re wary.

## **Technical and Fundamental Analysis: A Mixed Picture**

### **Technical Analysis**

From a technical standpoint, the charts reflect indecision. Bitcoin, at $85,530, sits below its 50-day moving average of $90,000, indicating short-term weakness.

Yet, it holds above the 200-day moving average of $75,000, preserving the long-term uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 is neutral—there are no overbought or oversold signals.

<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")

Key support lies at $80,000; a break below could accelerate selling. To maintain bullish momentum, resistance at $95,000 must be reclaimed.

Ethereum mirrors this. At $2,235, it’s below its 50-day moving average of $2,500 but above the 200-day moving average of $2,000.

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")

The RSI, at 38 - 40, is neutral. It also has support at $2,000; if breached, declines could deepen. Resistance at $2,800 is the breakout level to watch.

### **Fundamental Analysis**

Fundamentally, the backdrop is complex. Five percent inflation pressures fiat currencies, bolstering Bitcoin’s hedge appeal. The Fed’s hinted rate cuts in Q3 2025 could lift risk assets like crypto.

Moreover, institutional adoption grows as BlackRock and Fidelity deepen their ETF and custody stakes. The strategic crypto reserve could also drive demand if it is transparent, but its current ambiguity invites regulatory risks.

The reserve is a high-stakes gamble. It could legitimize crypto, drawing institutional capital and sparking a rally.

Furthermore, geopolitical tensions, like the Bybit hack, could spur flight to safety, and while it might be little, the market has proven to be resistance to them.

If the reserve avoids heavy-handed control and tensions ease, it’s a bull market catalyst. For now, its promise is still unclear.

## **Is the Bull Run Over? Sentiment and Indicators Say…**

The 20% drop from Bitcoin’s peak stings, but the current market suggests it’s not the end. Technically, the RSI hovers above 37—not oversold, hinting at a correction, not a collapse. Support at $80,000 for Bitcoin and $2,000 for Ethereum could hold if sentiment stabilizes.

Fundamentally, institutional backing and ETF growth argue that the bull run has legs as analysts still see $123,000 for Bitcoin and $4,591 for Ethereum by year-end.

However, there is a risk as leverage is high, and external shocks could deepen the slide.

Amidst all these, sentiment leans toward “dip, not doom”; it reflects a pause, not a bust. For you, this tilts toward holding unless macro fears outweigh your conviction.

## **When Will Crypto Go Back Up?**

Timing is tricky, but catalysts are brewing. A clear strategic reserve plan could spark a rally by summer 2025, especially if institutional cash flows in.

Tariff-driven inflation might also boost Bitcoin’s hedge appeal within months, while Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade could lift it by Q3.

On the other hand, geopolitical calm—or another hack—could sway the timeline.

However, the current sentiment strongly suggests a rebound by mid-2025, barring major disruptions. Holding positions you for this; selling now risks missing it.

## **Hold or Sell? Your Decision, Grounded in Today’s Reality**

Here’s the bottom line, tailored to March 5, 2025:

- **Hold If:** You believe in crypto’s long game. The strategic reserve’s potential, regulatory tailwinds, and historical resilience outweigh short-term FUD. If the $123,000 and $4,591 targets hold, Bitcoin at $85,530 and Ethereum at $2,235 look like discounts.
- **Sell If:** Geopolitical risks (hacks, tensions) and tariff fallout spook you. The reserve’s uncertainty and 20% drop signal volatility are ahead. Cashing out some gains—or cutting losses—makes sense if you can’t stomach more downside.
- **Mixed Approach:** Sell a portion to lock in profits or reduce risk, then hold the rest for a rebound. This balances today’s uncertainty with tomorrow’s upside.

## **Final Take**

The bull run isn’t over—it’s bruised but breathing. Sentiment is shaky but not broken, and current events like the strategic reserve and tariffs are stoking fear and greed.

Crypto could climb back by mid-2025, driven by adoption and macro shifts, but risks like hacks and economic slowdowns loom. Your move depends on your gut: Hold for the potential payoff, sell to dodge the storm, or split the difference. In crypto, chaos often precedes the next big win.
